# K-Means Clustering from Scratch
This project implements the K-Means clustering algorithm from scratch using only NumPy â€” no machine learning libraries involved in the core model.

Includes:
Full K-Means algorithm with centroid initialization, assignment, and update steps\n
Custom implementation using only NumPy (no scikit-learn clustering)\n
multiple 2D datasets\n
visualization using matplotlib

Datasets Generated using sklearn.datasets:
Blobs
Moons
Circles
Classification
